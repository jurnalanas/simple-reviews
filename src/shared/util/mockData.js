Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well. All in all XR rules",

In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera.  At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market.",

No dual Whatsapp so one number is wasted. No dual Facebook as well. Maximum 5gb cloud backup storage limit. Apps get refreshed more frequently and better enhancements on android. No features to search apps easily. Wifi once disconnected loses auto join features. Maximum 100 call records that’s very very annoying. Difficult to set primary and secondary sims in sms. Some Whatsapp features missing.",

So whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe it’s something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didn’t. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still don’t blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. It’s disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didn’t upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone.",

When I decided to buy this phone I checked on negative reviews first and after buying thought of using it first and then give a feedback. This is the perfect Phone with all advanced features for a normal user, which is worth for the price. Moving unto the flaws seen on the feedbacks, most of them complaining about the display being low resolution and LCD. In my opinion you won’t spot any difference with other iPhone displays. Another thing I’ve seen than lot of people complaining about the single camera, however, the picture quality you get will amuse you.",

    "review_text": "Bought this during Prime sale. I love to use Apple products because of its simplicity. I was using iPhone 6 and thought of updating. While the XS and XS Max are more than a Lakh in India, iPhone XR is bang for the buck. The prime day deal was more sweet and surprise to me. The operation and touch responses are silky smooth. Dual Sim with the eSIM works like a charm. Rear camera is awesome with face detection AI Bookeh in Portrait mode. Screen resolution is very good and crisp without any pixel issues. It lacks 3D Touch but Apple incorporated Taptic Engine which will be updated to replace 3D Touch functionality eventually (though some are present now, it is limited). Some APPs are not good in the notch area though but it is ok to manage. Overall a nice update.",

After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review.  Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10% to 100%. As I am used to iPhone home button, I’m feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So it’s a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as u have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if u use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when u have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory.",

The glass back looks ultra premium, though I would suggest you to get a back protective case as glass is fragile. Got it in white and had to pay 1400 extra but it looks the best in white. You are spending 60000 on a phone so what's 1400 more to get the best",

The phone is fast and smooth, you don’t feel like you are having just 3Gb of RAM, it handles anything you through at it without a hitch. The phone does feel premium and at the same time delicate because the backside is glass,”as you know glass is glass and glass will break”. The pictures taken from the camera are good but the lack of night scape sort of things is a con. Overall the phone is great, although the side bezels are thick, you get used to it. The LCD screen does not lack anything compared to the OLED’s in day to day usage. You just stop thinking those things when you are using daily.",

Amazingly it had 33 percent charge while I was leaving my office and I even played 3 evoground matches of pubg that day during my break.

Recently introduced iPhone 11 and XR have only one difference which is of Price. Most of the features are exactly same. Best Battery backup ever in an iPhone I must say. Soothing and flawless iOS.

    "review_text": "I purchased this phone (Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black) during the Amazone Deewali sale, working fine and no issues so far. Installation and configuration was pretty easy as my previous phone was also iphone. I have checked and verified the product and it is a genuine one. The convenience part  is copying contacts, photos , audio \u0026 video files took less than 2 min. In overall,  phone is  good and i got it for around 50K with a Credit card refund offer of 2.5k back after 3 months. But I didn’t receive the refund so far. Spoke to bank and they advised to get in touch with Amazon. Not sure where to reach now.",

You might wonder about thick bezels and LCD display on this phone. I bet you don’t notice them at all when you get along with this phone. No wonder why XR is the best selling smartphone worldwide.

I was confused between One plus 7 Pro, IPhone XS and the XR and I must admit that it turned out to be a good decision. Its a classy product and feels premium in hand compared to other devices in this price range. The features that the other phones boast about are hardly being used in day to day life unless you are an avid gamer. The screen size is just perfect and quality is not bad as being highlighted in some of the reviews on youtube. Battery life is excellent, camera is very good and the phone is waterproof. Performance is excellent with A12 Bionic processor.",

These devices with the A12 bionic chip just beat any other android devices in graphics rendering performance without a doubt. People have been complaining about the display that is basically 828p but trust me, you won’t even notice the difference between a proper 1080p screen and this one. In fact this screen looks better than most of the 1080p mobile phone screens (thanks to the liquid retina display technology it uses). The camera is amazing in all aspects and one of the best out there in the smartphone market but it can’t click portraits without detecting a human face (P.S. you can download an app named halide at the appstore to click non human portraits).",

I just ordered an 12W fast charger at 1K from amazon. It is a smart choice to get iPhone Xr at 40K over iPhone 11 at 59 K (Including HDFC bank offer).

The Face ID never works, the camera gets stuck on its portrait mode.. My honest feedback is not to but the iPhones anymore. Just will have to say that Apple lost itself a good customer..",
